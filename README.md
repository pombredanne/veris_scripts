# veris_scripts
A collection of scripts to look various things up in VERIS (https://github.com/vz-risk/veris) data such as VCDB (https://github.com/vz-risk/VCDB).  It is highly recommended to install verisr (https://github.com/vz-risk/verisr) and verisag (https://github.com/vz-risk/VERISAG) as they are regularly used in parsing veris data.
